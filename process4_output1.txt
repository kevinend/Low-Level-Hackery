Hello World
End of this program
Total number of instructions executed == 141722

The sample program, test.c, was a simple hello world program:

#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>

int main( void ) {

    printf( "Hello World\n" );
    return 0;
}

The high instruction count is probably due to the initialization and termination code of the CRT (_init/_exit)
as well as the length/complexity of printf.

*CRT is the C runtime library.
